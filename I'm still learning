I'm so lonely
I just want your love
I don't know what to do in life
please just be there for me
and never leave me
I know I make mistakes
I know I'm trouble
I know I'm an annoyance
but I'm still learning how to be a good person
still learning how to go places in life
learning how to not hurt the people close to me
so please be easy on me if I hurt you 
or make you uncomfortable
I'm still learning
so I'm sorry
